## Test Categories

### 1. API Route Tests

#### Server Routes (`servers.test.ts`)
**Coverage**: 25 test cases

**Endpoints Tested:**
- `GET /api/servers` - List servers with filtering
- `GET /api/servers/:id` - Server detail with relationships
- `POST /api/servers` - Server creation with validation
- `POST /api/servers/:id/start` - Start server with state checks
- `POST /api/servers/:id/stop` - Stop server with state checks
- `DELETE /api/servers/:id` - Delete server with job enqueuing
- `GET /api/servers/:id/logs` - Console log retrieval

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✓ Empty state handling
- ✓ Required field validation
- ✓ Invalid gameKey rejection
- ✓ Organization existence validation
- ✓ Status transition validation (CREATING → STOPPED → RUNNING)
- ✓ Job creation for async operations
- ✓ Idempotency checks (can't start running server)
- ✓ Concurrent operation prevention

**Known Issues Tested:**
- Server status must be valid before start/stop operations
- Jobs are properly enqueued to BullMQ
- Container ID handling for logs endpoint

#### SSO Routes (`sso.test.ts`)
**Coverage**: 15 test cases

**Endpoints Tested:**
- `POST /api/sso/discord/issue` - Magic link generation
- `GET /api/sso/discord/consume` - Magic link consumption
- `GET /api/sso/me` - Current user info
- `POST /api/sso/logout` - Session termination
- `POST /api/sso/dev/login` - Development login (non-prod)

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✓ Service token authentication
- ✓ User/org upsert on Discord login
- ✓ Membership creation with default role
- ✓ JWT generation with correct expiration (5min for magic links)
- ✓ Token reuse prevention
- ✓ Session cookie management
- ✓ Dev mode convenience login

#### Config Routes (`config.test.ts`)
**Coverage**: 20 test cases

**Endpoints Tested:**
- `GET /api/config/:id` - Retrieve server configuration
- `PUT /api/config/:id` - Update server configuration
- `GET /api/config/:id/history` - Configuration version history

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✓ Minecraft-only configuration support
- ✓ Default config for new servers
- ✓ Config validation (Zod schema)
- ✓ Config version tracking
- ✓ Restart notification for running servers
- ✓ History limiting (10 versions)
- ✓ Non-Minecraft server handling (501)

### 2. Worker Job Tests

#### Job Queue (`jobs.test.ts`)
**Coverage**: 20 test cases

**Functions Tested:**
- `enqueueCreate()` - CREATE job enqueuing
- `enqueueStart()` - START job enqueuing
- `enqueueStop()` - STOP job enqueuing
- `enqueueDelete()` - DELETE job enqueuing

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✓ Job creation in database
- ✓ Initial job state (PENDING, progress=0)
- ✓ Job-server relationship integrity
- ✓ Job lifecycle (PENDING → RUNNING → SUCCESS/FAILED)
- ✓ Progress tracking
- ✓ Error message storage
- ✓ Timestamp management (createdAt, startedAt, finishedAt)
- ✓ Cascade deletion with parent server
- ✓ Job querying by status and type
- ✓ Multiple jobs for same server

**Worker Logic (Not Unit Tested - Requires Docker):**
The actual worker execution (`server.worker.ts`) requires Docker daemon and is tested in E2E tests:
- Docker image pulling
- Container creation with port mapping
- Volume mounting
- Environment variable injection
- Container lifecycle management

### 3. End-to-End Tests

#### Authentication Flow (`authentication.spec.ts`)
**Coverage**: 6 test cases

**User Flows Tested:**
- ✓ Login page display for unauthenticated users
- ✓ Dev mode quick login
- ✓ Session cookie creation
- ✓ Dashboard redirect after login
- ✓ Logout functionality
- ✓ Session persistence on page reload

#### Server Lifecycle (`server-lifecycle.spec.ts`)
**Coverage**: 15 test cases

**Critical Paths Tested:**
- ✓ Server creation wizard flow
- ✓ Server appears in dashboard after creation
- ✓ Server status display (CREATING → STOPPED → RUNNING)
- ✓ Navigation to server detail page
- ✓ Start/stop button functionality
- ✓ Button state based on server status
- ✓ Delete confirmation modal
- ✓ Search functionality
- ✓ Status filtering
- ✓ Stats calculation and display
- ✓ Empty state handling
- ✓ Configuration tab for Minecraft servers

**Timing Considerations:**
- Tests include appropriate waits for async operations
- Polling intervals respected (5s for status, 2s for logs)
- Server creation may take 30-60 seconds in real environment

#### Console Logs (`console-logs.spec.ts`)
**Coverage**: 11 test cases

**Log Viewing Tested:**
- ✓ Console tab visibility and activation
- ✓ Monospace font styling
- ✓ Different messages based on server status
  - STOPPED: "Server is stopped"
  - CREATING: "Waiting for logs"
  - RUNNING: Display actual logs
- ✓ Refresh button functionality
- ✓ Auto-refresh indicator (2-second polling)
- ✓ Empty log state handling
- ✓ Console area height and scrolling
- ✓ Log line formatting

**Known Issue Addressed:**
Console log fetching from Docker containers now properly removes Docker's 8-byte header from log lines.

## Known Issues & Testing Notes

### 1. ARM64 Compatibility

**Issue**: Some Docker images don't support Apple Silicon (ARM64)

**Testing Approach**:
- Tests verify job enqueuing, not container success
- Worker tests focus on database state changes
- E2E tests check status transitions
- Actual container execution may fail on ARM64

**Recommendation**: Run full E2E tests on x86_64 CI/CD environment

### 2. Worker Job Processing

**Fixed**: Jobs now properly added to BullMQ queue

**Tests Verify**:
- Job records created in database
- Job IDs passed to BullMQ
- Status updates occur
- Error handling works

### 3. Console Log Fetching

**Issue**: Docker log format includes 8-byte headers

**Fix**: Log parsing now strips headers correctly

**Tests Verify**:
- Empty logs return empty array
- Logs without container ID handled gracefully
- 404 from Docker handled properly

### 4. Server Status Transitions

**Expected Flow**: CREATING → STOPPED → RUNNING

**Tests Verify**:
- Status changes at each lifecycle stage
- Start button disabled during CREATING
- Stop button disabled when STOPPED
- Status validation in routes

### 5. Timing & Async Operations

**Considerations**:
- Server creation: 30-60 seconds (Docker image pull)
- Status polling: 5-second intervals
- Log polling: 2-second intervals
- Tests include appropriate waits

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority

1. **Add Test Database**
   - Use separate test DB to avoid polluting dev data
   - Add `DATABASE_URL_TEST` environment variable
   - Reset DB state between test runs

2. **Mock Docker Operations**
   - Create Docker mock for unit testing worker
   - Test container operations without actual Docker
   - Faster test execution

3. **Expand E2E Coverage**
   - Test complete server deletion flow
   - Test configuration editor changes
   - Test error states (failed jobs)
   - Test ARM64 fallback messages

4. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test BullMQ queue processing
   - Test Redis connection handling
   - Test PostgreSQL transaction handling

### Medium Priority

5. **Component Unit Tests**
   - Add Vitest to web package
   - Test React components in isolation
   - Test custom hooks
   - Test state management (Zustand)

6. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Add Playwright visual comparisons
   - Test UI consistency across browsers

---

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Independent**
   - Each test should set up its own data
   - Clean up after test completion
   - Don't rely on test execution order

2. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - Test names should describe behavior
   - Use "should..." pattern
   - Include expected outcome

3. **Avoid Test Flakiness**
   - Use proper wait strategies
   - Don't use arbitrary timeouts
   - Handle async operations properly

4. **Update Tests with Code**
   - Tests are documentation
   - Update tests when requirements change
   - Add tests for bug fixes

### CI/CD Integration

**Recommended Pipeline**:

```yaml
test:
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm db:push
  - pnpm test:api        # Fast, runs first
  - pnpm test:e2e        # Slower, runs if API tests pass
  - pnpm test:report     # Generate report
```

**Required Environment**:
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for worker tests)
- x86_64 architecture (for full E2E)
